## Problem 1

``` r
# Function to check for duplicate birthdays
has_duplicates <- function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays)))
}

# Parameters
group_sizes <- 2:50
n_simulations <- 10000
probs <- numeric(length(group_sizes))

# Run simulations for each group size
for (i in seq_along(group_sizes)) {
  n <- group_sizes[i]
  results <- replicate(n_simulations, has_duplicates(n))
  probs[i] <- mean(results)
}

# Plot 
plot(group_sizes, probs, type = "l", col = "blue",
     xlab = "Group Size",
     ylab = "Probability of Shared Birthday",
     main = "Birthday Simulation")
abline(h = 0.5, col = "red", lty = 2)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("Probability", "50% Threshold"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), lty = c(1, 2))
```

**Comment:**

The plot illustrates how the probability that at least two people share
a birthday increases with the group size. Notably, around a group size
of 23, the probability crosses the 50% threshold. As the group size
approaches 50, the probability nears 100%, indicating that it becomes
almost certain for a duplicate birthday to occur in larger groups.
